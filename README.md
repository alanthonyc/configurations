This repo contains the settings and plugins that I use for the VIM editor.

Feel free to use them or to fork and improve them. I'm open to suggestions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo anywhere
1. set the $MYVIM environment variable to the path of the repo directory
1. set the $VIMINIT environment variable to "$MYVIM/.vimrc"
1. launch VIM and enjoy your code :)
